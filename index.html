                            <p> As odd as it sounds, the ransomware attack that swept across the world over the past few days
                                wasn't about the money. GoldenEye, also known as NotPetya, swarmed computers on Tuesday,
                                locking up devices at multibillion-dollar companies including FedEx, Merck, Cadbury and AP
                                Moller-Maersk. Combined, these four companies are worth about $130 billion -- big targets
                                with fat wallets. You'd think the hackers would ask for more than $300 per hijacked computer.
                                But now experts believe nation-state attackers are using ransomware as a screen, tempting
                                victims to blame faceless hackers instead of the countries allegedly behind the attacks."</p>

                                <p><b>GoldenEye the destroyer</b> Researchers from both Comae Technologies and Kaspersky Lab found
                                    that GoldenEye was a wiper, designed to destroy data. It used as its base a form of ransomware
                                    called Petya (hence the NotPetya name) to encrypt crucial files, steal login credentials
                                    and seize your hard drive, too. Even though the ransomware promised you'd get your data back
                                    if you paid up, Comae founder Matt Suiche noticed that GoldenEye actually ended up destroying
                                    several blocks of data. The original Petya encrypted files, but there was always a way to
                                    reverse that, he noted. Researchers from Kaspersky called this the "worst-case" scenario
                                    for the victims. "I wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to shut down a couple of facilities
                                    that they're targeting," said Amanda Rousseau, a malware researcher at Endgame. Petya ransomware
                                    cyber attack Getty Images GoldenEye started as an attack on a single organization, with the
                                    ransomware attaching itself to a software update for MeDoc, Ukraine's most popular tax-filing
                                    software. From that one victim, it spread to multibillion-dollar companies that were using
